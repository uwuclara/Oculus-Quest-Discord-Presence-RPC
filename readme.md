# Quest Discord RPC
This app allows you to put your current Oculus/Meta Quest game as Discord RPC status. 

This app currently doesn't support auto-start, but you can still add it to your start-up folder (you still have to press enter to use last known IP).

## How to use
You need to have Wireless ADB enabled in first place. 

Either thru usb with site-quest app/ADB or in headset itself using paid QuestGameOptimizer or free [app](https://github.com/thedroidgeek/oculus-wireless-adb)

Open QuestDiscordRPC.exe and enter IP address of your Oculus/Meta Quest or with cmd ./QuestDiscordRPC.exe 192.168.x.x . (It will remember next time you launch the app and just press enter)

### Compatibility
Should work on Quest 1/2/3/pro. Personally tested on Quest 2/3
